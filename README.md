## Working with variables

1. Declare two variables: admin and name.
2. Write the string "John" to the name variable.
3. Copy the value from the name variable to admin.
4. Display the value admin.

## What will be output of i and n?

let i = 10;
let n = i++ % 5;

## Swap two variables

let a = 10,
b = 3;

## Swap two variables without using the third one

let a = 10,
b = 3;
